<h1>About</h1>
<p>Heterogeneous Knowledge follows one statement: <b>"knowledge for one; knowledge for all."</b></p>
<p>This application was designed by a skillful set of students majoring in Computer Science, with the purpose of providing a toolset for professors to make test and assignment creation simplified.  The platform allows for students and teachers alike to conduct regular coursework through the use of any web browser.  It would give increased access to assignments and tests for students while giving professors more time to prepare for lectures, rather than spending time at a copy machine.  The Heterogeneous Knowledge team fully believe this examination tool will provide perfect synergy between paper and machine.</p>
