This is the source code of Heterogeneous Knowledge Examination Tool. Find the full readme in the parent folder.

#### Ensure you are using the right Ruby version and gemset if you have different ruby environments
In the `src` folder consult `.ruby-gemset` and `.ruby-version`, confirm they exist, and then run:
```
Â» rvm gemset list

gemsets for ruby-2.3.3 (found in /Users/username/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.3.3)
   (default)
   global
=> heterogeneous_knowledge
```

*If `heterogeneous_knowledge` is not visible, try cd-ing out of and in to the `src` folder.
`rvm` will automatically create it.*
