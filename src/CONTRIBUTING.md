# Contribution Handbook
This handbook is based on the [GitLab team handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/) and is the central repository for how we work on this project. It is licensed under [![CC-BY-SA 4.0](https://mirrors.creativecommons.org/presskit/buttons/80x15/svg/by-sa.svg)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/). Please make a [pull request](https://github.com/mikevo/uno-heterogeneous-knowledge/pulls) to suggest improvements or add clarifications or use [issues](https://github.com/mikevo/uno-heterogeneous-knowledge/issues) to ask questions.

## TLTR
* **Values**: We value results, transparency, sharing, freedom, efficiency,
collaboration, kindness, boring solutions.
* **Communication**: Prefere issue trackers over chat.
* **Workflow**: [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) and don't forget to open issues if you are working on something that everyone can see what you are working on.
* **Issue closing**: Do not close an issue until it is fully done, which means code has been merged, all issue trackers are updated and any documentation is written and merged.



## Values
We value results, transparency, sharing, freedom, efficiency,
collaboration, kindness, boring solutions:

1. **Results**: We care about what you achieve; the code you shipped, the user you made happy, and the team member you helped.
Do not compete by proclaiming how many hours you worked yesterday because we don't want someone who took the afternoon off to feel like they did something wrong.
Instead, celebrate the achievements of yourself and your teammates. We want people to have the desire to ship.
1. **Transparency**: Be open about as many things as possible. By making information public we can reduce the threshold to contribution and make collaboration easier.
Don't be afraid to admit you made a mistake or were wrong.
When something went wrong it is a great opportunity to say "What’s the [kaizen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen) moment here?" and find a better way without hurt feelings.
1. **Efficiency**: We care about working on the right things, not doing more than needed, and not duplicating work.
This enables us to achieve more progress which makes our work more fulfilling.
We do the [smallest thing possible and get it out as quickly as possible](https://about.gitlab.com/2017/01/04/behind-the-scenes-how-we-built-review-apps/).
If you make suggestions that can be excluded from the first iteration turn them into a separate issue that you link.
Don't write a large plan, only write the first step.
Close the meta issue after you defined the first iteration.
Trust that you'll know better how to proceed after something is released.
You're doing it right if you're slightly embarrassed by the minimal feature set shipped in the first iteration.
Give short answers to verbal questions so the other party has to opportunity to ask more or move on.
And keep 1 to many written communication short, as mentioned in [this HBR study](https://hbr.org/2016/09/bad-writing-is-destroying-your-companys-productivity): "A majority say that what they read is frequently ineffective because it’s too long, poorly organized, unclear, filled with jargon, and imprecise.".
1. **Collaboration**: Helping others is a priority, even when it is not related to the goals that you are trying to achieve.
You are expected to ask others for help and advice.
The person who has to do the work decides how to do it but you should always take the suggestions seriously and try to respond and explain.
1. **Kindness**: We don't want [jerks](http://bobsutton.typepad.com/my_weblog/2006/10/the_no_asshole_.html) in our team.
Give negative feedback in the smallest setting possible, one-on-one is preferred.
Clearly make negative feedback about the work itself, not the person.
When giving feedback always provide at least one clear and recent example.
If a person is going through a hard time in their personal life, then take that into account.
1. **Boring solutions**: Use the most simple and boring solution for a problem.
You can always make it more complex later if that is needed.
The speed of innovation for our project and product is constrained by the total complexity we have added so far, so every little reduction in complexity helps.
Don't pick an interesting technology just to make your work more fun, using code that is popular will ensure many bugs are already solved and its familiarity makes it easier for others to contribute.


## General Guidelines
1. We recognize that inspiration is perishable, so if you’re **enthusiastic** about something that generates great results in relatively little time feel free to work on that.
1. Do what is right for our **customers** and the rest of the community, do what is best over the long term, don't be evil.
1. We create **simple** software.
1. Do **not** make jokes or unfriendly remarks about race, ethnic origin, skin color, gender, or sexual orientation.
1. Use **inclusive** language. For example, prefer "Hi everybody" or "Hi people" to "Hi guys".
1. Share problems you run into, ask for help, be forthcoming with information and **speak up**.
1. Don't display surprise when people say they don't know something, as it is important that everyone feels comfortable saying "I don't know" and "I don't understand." (As inspired by [Recurse](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules).)
1. Work out in the **open**, try to use public issue trackers and repositories when possible.
1. Share solutions you find and answers you receive with the **whole community**.
1. If you make a mistake, don't worry, correct it and **proactively** let the affected party and your team know what happened, how you corrected it and how, if needed, you changed the process to prevent future mistakes.
1. You can always **refuse** to deal with people who treat you badly and get out of situations that make you feel uncomfortable.
1. Everyone can **remind** anyone in the project about these guidelines. If there is a disagreement about the interpretations, the discussion can be escalated to more people within the company without repercussions.
1. If you are unhappy with anything please let the team know as soon as you realize it. We want to solve problems while they are **small**.
1. For each action or comment, it helps to ask yourself (i) does this help the project achieve its strategic goals? (ii) is this in the project's interest, and finally, (iii) how can I contribute to this effort/issue in a constructive way?
1. There is no need for **consensus**, make sure that you give people that might have good insights a chance to respond (by /cc'ing them) but make a call yourself because [consensus doesn't scale](https://twitter.com/sama/status/585950222703992833).
1. Everything is **always in draft** and subject to change, including this handbook. So do not delay documenting things and do not include "draft" in the titles of documents. Ensure everyone can read the current state. Nothing will ever be finished.
1. Explicitly note what **next action** you propose or expect and from whom.
1. Before **replying** to a request, complete the requested task first. Otherwise, indicate when you plan to complete it in your response. In the latter case, always send a message after the task is subsequently completed.

## Communication
We're a **distributed**, **remote-working** team where people work remotely without missing out.
For this, we use **asynchronous communication** and are as open as we can be by communicating through public issues, chat channels,
and placing an emphasis on ensuring that conclusions of offline conversations are written down.

1. Use **asynchronous communication** when possible (issues and email instead of chat), issues are preferred over chat and [people should be able to do their work without getting interrupted by chat](https://m.signalvnoise.com/is-group-chat-making-you-sweat-744659addf7d#.21t7089jk). You are not expected to be available all the time, it is perfectly fine to wait with responding to issues and chat mentions until your planned work hours.
1. It is very OK to ask as many questions as you have, but ask them so many
people can answer them and many people see the answer (so use issues or public
chat channels instead of private messages) and make sure
you try to document the answers.
1. If you mention something (a pull request, issue, commit, webpage, comment,
etc.) please include a link to it.
1. All project data should be **shareable** by default. Don't use a local text
file but leave comments on an issue.
1. If you use chat please use a public channel whenever possible, mention the
person you want to reach if it is urgent. This ensures it is easy for other people
to chime in, and easy to involve other people, if needed.
1. In chat try to keep the use of keywords that mention the whole channel to a minimum. They should only be used for pings that are both urgent as well as important. By overusing channel mentions you make it harder to respond to personal mentions in a timely manner since people get pinged too frequently.

### Workflow
1. Always **create** an issue for things you work on. If it is worth spending time on, it is worth creating an issue for it since that enables other people to learn and help. You can always edit the description or close it when the problem is something different or disappears.
1. If two issues are related, **crosslink** them (a link from each issue to the other one). Put the link at the top of each issue's description with a short mention of the relationship (Report, etc.). If there are more than 2 issues, use one issue as the central one and crosslink all issues to this one.
1. After a discussion about a feature **update the issue body** with the consensus or final conclusions. This makes it much easier to see the current state of an issue for everyone involved in the implementation and prevents confusion and discussion later on.
1. Submit the **smallest** item of work that makes sense. When creating an issue describe the smallest fix possible, put suggestions for enhancements in separate issues and link them.
1. Do not leave issues open for a long time, issues should be **actionable** and realistic. If you are assigned to an issue but don't have time to work on it, assign it to someone else.
1. Make a conscious effort to **prioritize** your work. The priority of items depends on multiple factors: Is there a team member waiting for the answer? What is the impact if you delay it? How many people does it affect, etc.?
1. Use the public issue trackers for everything.
1. Pick issues from the current [milestone](https://github.com/mikevo/uno-heterogeneous-knowledge/milestones).
1. We try not to assign issues to people but to have people **pick issues** in a milestone themselves.
1. Assign an issue to yourself as soon as you start to work on it, but not before
that time. If you complete part of an issue and need someone else to take the next
step, **re-assign** the issue to that person.
1. When re-assigning an issue, make sure that the issue body contains the latest information. The issue body should be the **single source of truth**.
1. When you create a pull request, **mention** the issue(s) that it solves in the description.
1. Once a pull request is created, make sure to assign it to the proper person.
1. If you are assigned to review and merge a pull request and would like the creator to make some **changes**, comment on the pull request and assign it back to the creator. When they have addressed the concern, they will re-assign it to the reviewer.
1. If you are assigned to merge a pull request and there is a **merge conflict**, consider trying to resolve it **yourself** instead of asking the pull request creator to resolve the conflict. If it is easy to resolve you avoid a round trip between you and the creator, and the pull request gets merged sooner. This is a suggestion, not an obligation.
1. If you ask a question to a specific person, always start the comment by mentioning them; this will ensure they see it if their notification level is mentioned and other people will understand they don't have to respond.
1. Do not close an issue until it is fully done, which means code has been merged, all issue trackers are updated and any documentation is written and merged.
1. When **closing** an issue leave a comment explaining why you are closing the issue.
